To use:
1. Create `.env` with `token=` the value of your session cookie
2. `cargo run --no-default-features --features 'yearYYYY dayD [sample] [part2]' [--profile release]`
Inputs are gitignored but will be fetched with your token. Samples are pasted into files since I'm not gonna write a scraper for it.
